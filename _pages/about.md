The Applied Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Departamento de Ingeniería Informática (DIINF) at USACH is uniquely positioned at the intersection of artificial intelligence and its applications to contemporary problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis support and fair fishing. Our research is distinguished by the intelligent analysis of image and video data, a transversal feature that underpins our vast and varied lines of research.

Our research spans a wide range of topics, from the automatic classification of human sperm for male infertility to breast/prostate cancer diagnosis through biopsy analysis, low-dose computerized tomography reconstruction, dynamic AI medical foundation models, and video analysis for action recognition. This diversity reflects the breadth and depth of our research efforts.

Our lab's research is not just about advancing the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence, but also about making a tangible difference in our society's development. We place a strong emphasis on technology transfer, ensuring that our research contributes to real-world solutions. Our team of researchers, assistants, and students is dedicated to domain adaptation, applying current state-of-the-art methods to the data and conditions of our national reality.
